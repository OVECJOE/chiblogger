## Technologies

### Backend

## Inspiration
My aunt + my desire to build something that can be used by others was my inspiration.

## Challenges
I had a lot of challenges, ranging from the how limited the device I was using is to time.
I ran into many bugs during the early phase of development mostly because I didn't plan the project
properly. Not my fault though. I planned the project, but my laptop disrupt the plan.

## Concepts Learnt
Some of what I learnt are:
- How to google search faster
- How to scale a project from an initial idea to a more intense idea.
- I don't need to know everything at the beginning of a project.
- Exploring different options for a solution saves a lot of time.
