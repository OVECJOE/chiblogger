This is a customized health fitness blogging application built for my favorite aunt as a birthday present.

## Technologies
### Frontend
- React
- Context API (Hoping to switch to Redux in the nearest future)
- CSS (Hoping to introduce Chakra UI very soon)
- React Helmet (For SEO)
### Backend
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- MongoDB

## Inspiration
My aunt + my desire to build something that can be used by others was my inspiration.

## Challenges
I had a lot of challenges, ranging from the how limited the device I was using is to time. I ran into many bugs during the early phase of development mostly because I didn't plan the project properly. Not my fault though. I planned the project life cycle, but my laptop disrupt the plan.

I was using a 4GB, core i3, Dell laptop which was damn too slow to run React application during development, let alone using Nextjs and Sanity Studio (as I intended using).

## Concepts Learnt
Some of what I learnt are:
- How to google search faster
- How to scale a project from an initial idea to a more intense idea.
- I don't need to know everything at the beginning of a project.
- Exploring different options for a solution saves a lot of time.
